連奕維 b10902041: 1/3 Html+CSS implementation, Final Project Ideation

## Final Project Meeting Notes

連奕維 has three thoughts of ideation:
1. Refactor old website and add new features based on demands
2. Packing some computer science cli tools to UI services(Like LLM service, Workstation Monitor)
3. Gain data by streaming free api or free database data, reproduce service to sell the data.

楊慶彥 thinks that the project core is more important, seeking for the subject of the project.

連奕維 found that http://www.bsaila.com.tw/cups/list.aspx?cid=1 is one example that can be refactored.

Final deal: Volleyball is 連奕維 and 游立宇's interest, we plan to refactor the old site. The main purpose of the site is make hosting a platform for saling sport contest, especially team contest. 

### Some Refactor Contents

- Beautify UI (event photos)
